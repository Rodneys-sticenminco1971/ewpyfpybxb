So I just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Last Breath, and I'm still kinda like, what did I just see? That   was like being on a roller coaster… underwater… in the dark. The whole time I was gripping my seat like it was gonna somehow save me from drowning. Classic me, though, because I literally can't swim. Wouldn't survive five seconds without a floaty. But 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this poor guy trapped under the sea with practically no oxygen left was... not exactly a confidence booster in my survival skills.

The whole 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 felt like someone was squeezing my heart with wet hands, kind of slippery but incredibly intense. At one point, I might have squeezed my popcorn too hard, and yeah, those buttery little demons scattered everywhere. Whoops. Maybe I was more into the   than I realized?

There was this strange comfort in the panic though, which sounds completely bonkers when I say it out loud. But honestly, it’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone else living your worst nightmare and thinking, “see, I KNEW staying at home in my pajamas was better.” But then again, there was something beautifully human about it all. You know? Like, dude, their team didn't stop believing he could make it. I should find friends like that, except maybe not the kind to drag me to deep sea adventures.

> Wait, why are we even so obsessed with searching the ocean floor? I can barely search for my keys in my gigantic purse half the time, and that's dry land.

Anyway, there’s a scene near the end with that last breath (ha, get it?) that I’ve replayed in my brain about a hundred times already. It’s like trying to remember exactly why you went into the kitchen but getting distracted by the cookies. That's the kind of feeling this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 leaves me with. And even now while typing this… still got a bit of the heebie-jeebies thinking about it. Maybe I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see if I missed something. Or not. Why am I even considering that?

```c
// Why am I doing this? What does this have to do with anything?
int main() {
    printf(Breathe...);
    return 0;
}
```

Honestly, if you're up for a wild ride filled with anxiety, I'd say 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Just don't drag me back to sea unless you’re buying me a giant yacht and an army of lifeguards. Now where's my coffee… or my sanity, for that matter?
